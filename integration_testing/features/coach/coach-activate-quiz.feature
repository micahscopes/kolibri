      When I click the *Open Quiz* button
      Then I see a modal asking me to confirm the change
      When I click *Continue* in that modal
      Then that modal window disappears
        And the button changes to *Close Quiz*
        And *Opened x seconds ago* appears beneath the button
        And I see a snackbar notification saying *Quiz Opened*
      When I click *Cancel* in that modal
        Then that modal window disappears
          And the status does not change
          And the *Open Quiz* button remains in place
